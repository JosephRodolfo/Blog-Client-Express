# Blog client

A REST API client for a simple blog using mongoose, express, and nodejs. I bootstrapped the project with NPM module create-nodejs-express-app for boilerplate. The boilerplate itself was well beyond anything I had done before, but I learned a ton from playing around with it about how real rest APIs are set up and function.
